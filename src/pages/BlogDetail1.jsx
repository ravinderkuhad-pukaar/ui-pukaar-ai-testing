            <p>
                Becoming a parent brings happiness, but it also brings moments of uncertainty and worry, especially in the early months. Some days feel smooth, while others feel overwhelming without a clear reason.
            </p>

            <p>
                When a baby cries suddenly, parents often feel confused and anxious. Questions come quickly: Is my baby hungry? Tired? Uncomfortable? Is this normal?
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Pukaar AI</strong> is designed to support parents during these exact moments. It helps turn daily baby behaviour into clear understanding, so parents feel less stressed and more confident.
            </p>

            <p>
                The goal isn't perfection. The goal is helping parents feel informed, supported, and calm—every single day.
            </p>

            <h2>A Smarter Approach to Everyday Baby Care</h2>

            <p>
                Modern parents have access to endless information, but not always clear guidance. Too much advice often creates more confusion than comfort.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pukaar AI focuses on real daily routines, small changes, and patterns that parents actually see. Instead of guessing or reacting in panic, parents begin to understand what's happening and respond with confidence.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over time, baby care feels simpler, clearer, and more manageable.
            </p>

            <h2>Everyday Challenges Parents Face</h2>

            <p>
                When babies cry without warning, parents often experience stress and self-doubt, unsure how to respond.
            </p>

            <p>
                Feeding routines can feel inconsistent. Appetite changes create feeding concerns and constant second-guessing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sleep is another major worry. Newborn sleep patterns are unpredictable, making nights exhausting and confusing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many parents worry about baby behaviour, questioning whether changes are normal or something to be concerned about.
            </p>

            <p>
                With advice coming from family, friends, and the internet, parents often feel overwhelmed instead of supported.
            </p>

            <h2>How Pukaar AI Helps Parents</h2>

            <p>
                Pukaar AI is built around real parent worries, not generic checklists.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>It helps parents observe patterns in crying, feeding, and sleep, so daily moments start making sense together.</li>
                <li>The app provides simple explanations without medical jargon, making insights easy to understand.</li>
                <li>All baby-care information stays organised in one place, reducing stress and constant searching.</li>
                <li>By cutting through mixed advice, Pukaar AI helps parents feel calmer and more confident.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Pukaar AI Turns Worry Into Understanding</h2>

            <p>This is how Pukaar AI actually works—step by step.</p>

            <h3>1. Parents notice what's happening</h3>
            <p>
                Parents simply record crying episodes, feeding changes, or sleep disruptions—no technical terms, no pressure.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Pukaar AI connects patterns over time</h3>
            <p>
                Instead of analysing one moment, the app looks at behaviour across days to find meaningful patterns.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Clear insights replace guessing</h3>
            <p>
                Parents receive easy-to-understand explanations about what might be happening and why.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Parents know what to observe next</h3>
            <p>
                Rather than reacting with panic, parents get calm direction on what to watch or adjust gently.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Confidence builds naturally</h3>
            <p>
                As understanding grows, parents feel less anxious, more informed, and better prepared for daily care.
            </p>

            <h2>Designed for New & First-Time Parents</h2>

            <p>
                Feeling unsure doesn't mean you're doing something wrong—it means you care.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pukaar AI doesn't replace parental instincts or medical care. It works alongside parents, helping them understand their baby better without judgement.
            </p>

            <p>
                As babies grow and routines change, the support adapts—helping parents move through each stage with clarity and reassurance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some days feel easy. Some days don't. Pukaar AI helps parents handle both with calm, confidence, and understanding.
            </p>
