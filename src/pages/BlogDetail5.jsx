            <p>
                The first few weeks with a newborn bring many questions. Small changes in breathing, digestion, skin colour, or body temperature can worry parents quickly. While many symptoms are normal, understanding what needs attention helps parents feel calmer and more prepared.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Pukaar Ai, we focus on helping parents understand these early health signs without panic. This guide covers common newborn health concerns, including breathing problems, constipation, jaundice, fever, and ways to protect newborns from infections.
            </p>

            <h2>Newborn Breathing Problems</h2>

            <p>
                Newborn breathing can look irregular, especially in the first few weeks. Babies may breathe faster, pause briefly, or make soft noises while sleeping. In many cases, this is part of normal development as their lungs adjust.
            </p>

            <p>
                Parents should observe carefully if breathing seems consistently difficult. Rapid breathing for long periods, chest pulling in while breathing, flaring nostrils, or bluish colour around the lips may need medical attention. If breathing ever feels unusual, seeking professional advice is important.
            </p>

            <h2>Newborn Constipation Remedies</h2>

            <p>
                Bowel movement patterns vary widely in newborns. Some babies pass stools several times a day, while others may skip days. This difference is often normal.
            </p>

            <p>
                Constipation becomes a concern when stools are hard, dry, or painful to pass. Gentle tummy massage, leg movement, and ensuring proper feeding can help. At Pukaar Ai, we always recommend avoiding home remedies without guidance, especially for very young babies.
            </p>

            <p>
                If discomfort continues, a healthcare professional should be consulted.
            </p>

            <h2>Newborn Jaundice Symptoms</h2>

            <p>
                Jaundice is common in newborns and usually appears as yellowing of the skin or eyes during the first week. Mild jaundice often resolves naturally as the baby's body processes bilirubin.
            </p>

            <p>
                Parents should monitor changes carefully. If the yellow colour spreads, lasts longer than expected, or affects feeding and alertness, medical advice should be sought. Early observation helps ensure timely care.
            </p>

            <h2>Infant Fever Treatment</h2>

            <p>
                Fever in infants can be concerning, particularly in babies under three months. Even a mild temperature increase should be taken seriously.
            </p>

            <p>
                Parents should avoid giving medication without medical guidance. Keeping the baby comfortable and contacting a healthcare provider promptly is the safest approach. At Pukaar Ai, we encourage parents to track symptoms calmly and act early when something feels off.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Protect Newborns from Infections</h2>

            <p>
                Newborns have developing immune systems, which makes prevention especially important. Simple daily habits can significantly reduce infection risks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Parents can protect newborns by:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Washing hands before handling the baby</li>
                <li>Limiting contact with sick visitors</li>
                <li>Avoiding crowded places when possible</li>
                <li>Keeping feeding and sleeping areas clean</li>
                <li>Following recommended vaccinations</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These small steps go a long way in keeping newborns safe.
            </p>

            <h2>A Note for Parents</h2>

            <p>
                Caring for a newborn is not about reacting to every symptom with fear—it is about learning what is normal for your baby and knowing when to seek help. Confidence grows through observation, experience, and the right support.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Pukaar Ai, we believe parents should feel informed, not overwhelmed. Paying attention to patterns, trusting your instincts, and reaching out when needed helps turn uncertainty into confidence over time. No parent has all the answers on day one, and that is perfectly okay.
