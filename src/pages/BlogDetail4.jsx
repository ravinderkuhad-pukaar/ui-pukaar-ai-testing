                One of the most common worries for new parents is sleep. You feed your baby, change the diaper, rock them for a long time—and still, sleep doesn't come easily. If you are dealing with a baby sleep problem, you are not alone. This phase is challenging for many families, especially in the early weeks.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Pukaar Ai, we often hear from parents who feel confused and tired during this stage. Understanding how newborn sleep works can help reduce stress and make nights feel more manageable.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Baby Sleep Problems Are So Common</h2>

            <p>
                Newborns are still adjusting to life outside the womb. Their body clock is not developed yet, which means day and night feel the same to them. This is one of the main reasons baby sleep problems happen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other common reasons include frequent feeding needs, discomfort, growth spurts, and overstimulation. Babies also spend more time in light sleep, which makes them wake easily. These patterns are normal, even though they feel exhausting.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Pukaar Ai, we remind parents that newborn sleep does not follow adult routines, and that understanding this can ease a lot of worry.
            </p>

            <h2>Common Baby Sleep Problems Parents Face</h2>

            <p>
                Many parents notice similar sleep challenges in the first few months:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Baby waking up frequently at night</li>
                <li>Short naps during the day</li>
                <li>Baby sleeping only when held</li>
                <li>Crying when placed in the crib</li>
                <li>Difficulty settling down</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These baby sleep problems usually improve with time as babies grow and routines slowly form.
            </p>

            <h2>Newborn Sleep Tips That Make a Difference</h2>

            <p>
                Instead of strict schedules, gentle habits often work better for newborns. These newborn sleep tips are commonly shared with parents using Pukaar Ai:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Watch for early sleep cues like yawning or slower movement</li>
                <li>Keep night-time feeding calm and quiet</li>
                <li>Create a simple bedtime routine, even if it is short</li>
                <li>Let your baby sleep when they seem tired</li>
                <li>Avoid too much noise or stimulation before sleep</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Small, consistent habits often make sleep feel easier over time.
            </p>

            <h2>Understanding Newborn Sleep Patterns</h2>

            <p>
                Newborns sleep in short cycles and wake easily. They may sleep many hours in a day, but not all at once. This is why parents often feel their baby "never sleeps."
            </p>

            <p>
                Over time, sleep patterns slowly become more organised. Many parents using Pukaar Ai find that observing daily routines helps them notice gradual improvements without forcing sleep too early.
            </p>

            <h2>When Do Baby Sleep Problems Improve?</h2>

            <p>
                Most baby sleep problems improve naturally as babies mature. Around three to four months, many babies begin to show longer night stretches, though every baby develops at a different pace.
            </p>

            <p>
                Temporary sleep disruptions can still happen due to teething, illness, or developmental changes. If sleep concerns feel severe or affect feeding or growth, speaking with a healthcare professional is always recommended.
            </p>

            <h2>Helping Parents Feel Calm About Baby Sleep</h2>

            <p>
                Sleep struggles can leave parents feeling tired and unsure. The most important thing to remember is that baby sleep develops gradually. There is no single method that works for every family.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Pukaar Ai, the focus is on helping parents understand baby sleep problems and apply gentle newborn sleep tips that fit real daily life.
            </p>

            <h2>A Reassuring Note for Parents</h2>

            <p>
                Baby sleep improves step by step. With patience, routine, and the right support, both you and your baby will rest better.
